I'm Gulden Draak: I'm gay, polyamorous and I live in Philadelphia. I'm currently an organizer of the event [Tickle Fest](https://www.tklfest.com/) and I have taught rope classes at kink events, private parties as well as tutored monogamous couples. I'm passionate about contributing to kink spaces so that people feel safe and can celebrate the parts of themselves they've felt shameful about.

When I began seriously persuing bondage, I started learning by subbing. I learned a lot about what felt good, what made me feel safe ...and also what didn't. I practiced as much as I could, and I started going to bondage clubs in DC and New York to learn from more experienced riggers. Finally, I found [Bound in Boston](https://www.boundinboston.com/farewell.aspx) which was simply the most welcoming and content-rich event for bondage I have ever been to. Sadly the event has come to an end, though it looks like [Tethered Together](https://tetheredtogether.net/) has taken its place. I recognize that not everyone can, or wants to, take a similar path to learning bondage, so I created this resource page to help people get started in the comfort of their own homes.

"Gulden Draak" means "Golden Dragon" in Dutch, but it's also the name of a dark triple ale. It means that the name of this site, "Rope Draak" translates to "rope dragon" which sounds kind of badass. My logo is a sheetbend which is used to connect two ropes even if they're different diameters or materials. My favorite part of bondage is that it has the potential to bring about incredible intimacy and connection between people through vulnerability. 

Thanks for visiting the site, and feel free to reach out.

Here's a few books I highly recommend:
