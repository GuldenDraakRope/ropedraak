I go by "Gulden Draak" or just "Draak" online, I'm gay and polyamorous. I'm currently an organizer of the event [Tickle Fest](https://www.tklfest.com/) and I have taught rope classes at kink events and private parties as well as tutored monogamous couples. I'm passionate about contributing to kink spaces so that people feel safe and can celebrate the parts of themselves they've felt shameful about.

When I began seriously persuing bondage, I started learning by subbing. I learned a lot about what felt good, what made me feel safe ...and also what didn't. But there was really only so much progress I could make on my own. I started going to bondage clubs in DC and New York to learn from more experienced riggers, and finally found [Bound in Boston](https://www.boundinboston.com/farewell.aspx) which was simply the most welcoming and content-rich event for bondage I have ever been to. Sadly the event has come to an end, although it looks like [Tethered Together](https://tetheredtogether.net/) has taken its place. I recognize that not everyone can, or wants, to take a similar path to learning bondage so I created this resource page to help people get started in the comfort of their own homes.

My logo is a sheetbend which is used to connect two ropes even if they're different diameters or materials. My favorite part of bondage is that it has the potential to bring about incredible intimacy and connection between people. 

"Gulden Draak" means "Golden Dragon" in Dutch, but it's also the name of a dark triple ale. It means that the name of this site, "Rope Draak" translates to "rope dragon" which sounds kind of badass.

Thanks for visiting the site, and feel free to reach out.
