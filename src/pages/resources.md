###[The Ashley Book of Knots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ashley_Book_of_Knots) - Clifford W. Ashley
The Ashley Book of Knots is an extensive encyclopedia and by far one of the most comprehensive works on practical knots.

###[Animated Knots by Grog](https://www.animatedknots.com/complete-knot-list)
An incredible resource with by far the clearest visual instructions on tying all kinds of practical knots. Much of the work presented is originally from The Ashley Book of Knots. For bondage, I recommend people learn the [sheetbend](https://www.animatedknots.com/sheet-bend-knot) and the [midshipman's hitch](https://www.animatedknots.com/midshipmans-hitch-knot).

###[Innovative Fiber Arts / Vermont Rope Bondage](http://ifavermont.blogspot.com/)
A group of experienced riggers and skilled instructors that use videos to show a multitude of bondage ties. I recommend learning the [burlington bowline](https://ifavermont.blogspot.com/2013/11/the-burlington-bowline.html) if you need a new single column tie.
